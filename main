To achieve the expected deliverables of launching an EC2 instance using Terraform, connecting to the instance, and installing Jenkins, Java, and Python on it, you can follow the steps below. Please note that this is a high-level overview, and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements and AWS setup.

Prerequisites:

    An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
    AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.
    Terraform installed on your local machine.
    A key pair created in AWS.

Step 1: Create a Terraform Configuration File

Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) with the following content:

hcl

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Change to your desired region
}

resource "aws_instance" "jenkins_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" # Replace with your desired AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro" # Change to your desired instance type
  key_name      = "your-keypair-name" # Replace with your key pair name

  tags = {
    Name = "Jenkins-Instance"
  }
}

Replace the ami, instance_type, and key_name with appropriate values for your setup. You can find the desired AMI ID in the AWS Management Console.

Step 2: Initialize Terraform

In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration file and run:

bash

terraform init

This initializes Terraform and downloads the necessary provider plugins.

Step 3: Create the EC2 Instance

Run the following command to create the EC2 instance:

bash

terraform apply

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type yes to proceed. Terraform will create the EC2 instance based on your configuration.

Step 4: Connect to the EC2 Instance

After the EC2 instance is created, you can use SSH to connect to it. Replace <public_ip> with the actual public IP address of your instance:

bash

ssh -i /path/to/your/keypair.pem ec2-user@<public_ip>

Step 5: Install Jenkins, Java, and Python

Once connected to the instance, you can install Jenkins, Java, and Python. Here are the basic commands for a CentOS-based instance (you might need to adjust them for other distributions):

bash

# Update the package manager
sudo yum update -y

# Install Java
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y

# Install Python
sudo yum install python3 -y

# Install Jenkins
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y

# Start Jenkins service
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

Step 6: Access Jenkins Web Interface

You can access the Jenkins web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://<public_ip>:8080. You will need to retrieve the Jenkins initial admin password from the server and follow the setup wizard to complete the Jenkins installation.

That's it! You've automated the provisioning of an EC2 instance using Terraform and installed Jenkins, Java, and Python on it using Ansible. Please ensure you have the necessary security groups and network configurations in place to allow SSH and Jenkins access.
